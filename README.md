Twitter Text Analysis

a.The top n users who have tweeted the most for the entire timeline.

b.The top n users who have tweeted the most for every hour.

c.The top n users who have the maximum followers.

d.The top n tweets which have the maximum retweet count.

Instruction: There are four separate functions contained within that will interact with a .txt file written by Twitter.py. Twitter.py fetches and crwals the desired topic tweets. Every function in textanalysis.py will ask for an input path file to read.

To run all together you can use the committed code. To run four separate functions and get only that particular output, it is enough if you run the desired function alone.
